# StaffSync

**A&E Operations Optimisation and Analytics Platform**

StaffSync is a Streamlit-based analytical and decision-support system designed for Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments. The platform integrates operations research, statistical analysis, and machine learning to support operational planning, performance monitoring, and breach risk prediction.

The application is intended for academic, analytical, and operational use, with an emphasis on transparency, auditability, and reproducibility.

---

##  Project Objectives

The primary objectives of StaffSync are to:

- Analyse operational performance in A&E departments
- Optimise staff scheduling under multiple constraints and objectives
- Provide statistical insight through controlled sampling and inference
- Predict four-hour breach risk using a trained machine learning model
- Maintain a complete audit trail of system interactions and data changes

---

##  System Architecture

The system is implemented as a modular Streamlit application with a clear separation between user interface logic, optimisation models, data handling, and auditing.

##  Application Workflow

1. The user launches the application and uploads an A&E dataset or loads the provided sample dataset
2. Data is validated and stored in session state
3. The user navigates between functional modules via the sidebar
4. All actions are logged to a timestamped audit file
5. Optimisation, analytics, and predictions are performed interactively

---

##  Functional Modules

###  Dashboard
- Overview of admissions, breach rates, staffing levels, and service times
- Visual analysis of patient load by HRG category

###  Scheduling Optimisation
Three optimisation models are provided:
- Cost minimisation
- Workload fairness
- Skill-based staff assignment

Each model supports:
- Full schedule display
- Operator-level inspection
- Visual daily workload plots

Optimisation models are implemented using linear programming techniques.

###  Clinical Analytics
- Age distribution analysis
- Length of stay versus congestion analysis
- Interactive scatter plots and histograms

###  Sampling and Statistical Inference
- Random sampling with reproducible seeds
- Descriptive statistics
- Covariance and correlation analysis
- Distribution visualisation for numerical and categorical variables
- Time-of-day arrival analysis

###  Breach Prediction
- Machine learning–based four-hour breach prediction
- Trained XGBoost model with preprocessing pipeline
- Probability-based outputs with visual interpretation
- Manual feature input for scenario testing

###  Data Management
- Search and filter records
- Range-based selection and modification
- Controlled deletion and updates
- Full audit logging of all data operations

###  Audit Logging
All system actions are logged, including:
- Data uploads and loads
- Optimisation runs
- Predictions
- Data modifications and deletions
- System resets and exits

Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory and can be viewed or downloaded directly from the application.

##  Data

The repository includes a sample dataset (`AED4weeks.csv`) representing four weeks of A&E activity. Users may also upload their own datasets, provided the schema matches the expected format.

**Note:** This system is intended for academic and analytical purposes. It is not intended for direct clinical deployment without appropriate validation and governance.
